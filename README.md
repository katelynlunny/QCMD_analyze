# QCMD_analyze
This repository includes a Matlab script, a README file, and a copy of a working data file. The Matlab script was created with the intent to calculate Sauerbrey mass and thin film compliance from QCM-D data measurements. The script is still undergoing changes to improve the amount of work required from the user.
